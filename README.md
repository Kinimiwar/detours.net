# detours.net
DÃ©tours.net use CLR as hooking engine. It's based on detours project from Microsoft and ability of CLR to generate transition stub for managed function to be called from unmanaged code.

*detours.net* is as simple to use as *DllImport* attribute for _pinvoke_ unmanaged code from managed code.

## Generate a plugin

Imagine you want to use *notepad.exe* to see PE header into *notepad.exe*, you have to use *detours.net*. 

First step is to generate a plugin.

Plugin is simple a .net DLL link with *detoursnet.dll* assembly.

Then you have to tell *detours.net* how and from which API you want to hook. You just have to declare a delegate which match your target function signature, and declare your associate hook like this :

```c#
// Declare your delegate
public delegate IntPtr CreateFileWDelegate(
    [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)] string lpFileName,
    uint dwDesiredAccess,
    uint dwShareMode,
    IntPtr SecurityAttributes,
    uint dwCreationDisposition,
    uint dwFlagsAndAttributes,
    IntPtr hTemplateFile
);

// And now declare your hook
[Detours("kernel32.dll", typeof(CreateFileWDelegate))]
public static IntPtr CreateFileW(
    string lpFileName,
    uint dwDesiredAccess,
    uint dwShareMode,
    IntPtr SecurityAttributes,
    uint dwCreationDisposition,
    uint dwFlagsAndAttributes,
    IntPtr hTemplateFile
)
{
...
}
```

That's all. Build your assembly, and run it with *detoursnetruntime.exe*.

```bat
.\detoursNetRuntime myhook.dll c:\windows\notepad.exe
```
